# Testing `create-react-app` with `babel-plugin-component-identification`
We were investigating ways of making our testing tools easier to use with our React app. This is just a quick test to see how easy it is to use `babel-plugin-component-identification` with `create-react-app` and how effective it is.

## Running
This was created with `create-react-app`, so you can start the dev server with
```
yarn start
```
